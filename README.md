### Project introduction
A simple to-do list in the form of a command line interface, built with Rust and SQL. CLIs are cool and we thought a to-do list would be a fun idea.  

### Technical overview
Should be do tasks such as:
- Create multiple to-do lists
- Add/remove tasks within a to-do list
- Check/uncheck tasks within a to-do list
- Display to-do lists
- Display all tasks within a list
- Store and update all data efficently in a SQL database  

Ideally work on the Rust aspect of the project and get the above tasks completed for checkpoint 1. Learn SQL and incorporate it within the Rust project for checkpoint 2. 

### Challenges
- We don't know SQL! So that part might be a little difficult.
